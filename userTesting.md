### Abu samer :
- suggested to use ideas from an app called allInfo
- maybe use different languages for the future eng/heb
- +1 for being just for nazareth
- spoke alot about how to market the app for example : if a restaurant wants to be on the app he has to pay a certain amount of money.
- overall he thinks its great

### 2 tourists from england
- pins are really close to each other which looks kinda bad and nazareth is small so that needs a fix
- there was not enough pins on the map.
- they could not find the return/cross button
- they were not sure if the information is right or validate
- +1 for pictures on the info tab
- they wanted an option to have lots of information or a short summary.
- they suggested that we start the map more zoomed out.
they are not sure that are capable to add to the map.
- they showed us an app called 'visiacity'
- they could not find the marker after the added it.

### Sally from Liwan
- She suggested deciding what are the interesting locations to visit, some of the first things that came to mind were restaurants and locations of religious significance
- It was pointed out that our app is severely missing out on information, including information on how to get to places
- At first she started out by only scrolling around the map and didn't click on anything, she said that the app was not convenient for use and that it was not at all clear to her what to do. But once it was explained to her how to add nuggets and how to see information she said that this app was easy to use, that its convenient to use and that she loved it
- There was alot of emphasis on visual information, she wanted a better map with lines to make it easier to get to places, and she wanted clear landmarks and for the pictures to be so accurate so as to be very close to what the real thing looks like. She also wanted to know where she could park at said landmarks, a way to reserve a room, and clear names that she could search and look around for or even other things that are related to the landmark or similar to it
- Said that as someone related to the tourism industry, it's very important for the app to have infotmation on all the places must be had
-


### A foreigner at a restaurant
- Said he would like to know basic traffic info
- It was not clear to him where is the old city located, and to make it clear where he himself is located in relation to it
- Wanted to know if there's a way to change his mind on the info he posted, when he realized the cancellation button was below, he suggested putting the cancellation button above where it will be clear where it is on first sight
- SAid that the app would be most useful once it has information for most cities

### Dan Sofer
how would you explore a city?
- Nazareth, it’s small so would just wander around
- would use an app if it was good
- don’t want to spend all my time with my head in a guidebook
- most important thing probably find the good food/cafes

on seeing the app:
- book icon means bible?
- what’s the yellow thing?
- ooh food!
- maybe a legend would be useful for different icons?

re-location button is bad:
- unclear that it’s going to move the map
- very bad UX (undeniably should be changed)

when adding:
- cool animation!
- location screen was natural to navigate
- want a shopping category?
